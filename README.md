# BabyȾau

BabyȾau is an organizational tool to help with bug hunting. It enables one to point to a website and extract relevant data such as javascript and urls. It uses a postgresql database to save the data which enables one to use sql to extract information from the saved data. The name is an anagram of the acronym [AYBABTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us "Wikipedia").
